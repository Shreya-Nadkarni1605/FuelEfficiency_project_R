# FuelEfficiency_project_R

## Problem statement
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Fuel Economy Guide provides fuel efficiency data for cars and trucks. A sample of the data for 311 compact, midsized, and large cars is provided in fueldata.csv.

The Class column identifies the size of the car; Compact, Midsize, or Large. The Displacement column shows the engine’s displacement in liters. The FuelType column shows whether the car uses premium (P) or regular (R) fuel, and the HwyMPG column shows the fuel efficiency rating for highway driving in terms of miles per gallon.

As a Business Analyst, you are asked to use this data to predict the fuel efficiency for highway driving given the engine’s displacement for each class of cars.
